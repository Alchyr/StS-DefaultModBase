# StS-Default Mod Base

Welcome to this mildly over-commented Slay the Spire modding base. 

This is a minimal "default clean slate" for creating Slay the spire mods. 

Use it to make your own mod of any type - If you want to add any standard in-game content (Character, cards, relics), this is a good starting point.

It features 1 character (the Default) with a minimal set of things: 1 card of each type, 1 debuff, 1 relic, etc.

(Currently, there are still some stuff missing (such as game patching examples and potions) which I plan to add later but I have other mods I wanna work on more.

If you're new to modding, I highly recommend going though the BaseMod wiki for whatever you wish to add and work your way thought your made with this base. Another very important thing is to look at other mods as well as the bsae-game code and see how they do things. Again, refer to the basemod wiki for that.

This base itself isn't going to help you code or anything!! While I have been put comments notating what does what, this is just a nice starting point if You need a place to start learning from that's not an absolute empty canvas, or an overly-complicated, difficult to understand mod. But you still need to learn how the in-game code works and how to piece things together on your own. (i.e. this base will show you where to put the code for double-tap, but not what it is/how to write it/how it works. Look up the actual cards and backward-engeneer them for that.)

Feel free to use this in any way you like, of course. 

If you have any issues with the code/bugs etc. feel free to add an issue.
If you want to recommend and/or add something to the mod that you feel would be helpful, feel free to put up a request or a branch!

Happy modding!
